**📦 Task 2: Dart Basic - Building eCommerce Application**

This is a simple **command-line eCommerce application** developed using **Dart**, as part of the `2025-project-phase-mobile-tasks` internship project. The application allows users to add, view, edit, and delete products using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles for clean and modular code.

---

##  Features
-  Add a new product
-  View all products
-  View a single product
-  Edit a product (name, description, price)
- Delete a product
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., out-of-range index)

---

##  Technologies Used

- Dart SDK
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/game-ale/2025-project-phase-mobile-tasks.git
cd 2025-project-phase-mobile-tasks/on-boarding/product-2

2. Run the Application

dart run

 OOP Concepts Applied
Encapsulation – Fields like _name and _products are private, with public getters/setters.

 Abstraction – The ProductManager hides internal list management.

 Reusability – Product objects are modular and reusable.

 Cascade Notation – Cleaner syntax for object property updates.
